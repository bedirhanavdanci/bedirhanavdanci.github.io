Hello! My name is Bedirhan Avdancı, and I am a biology graduate (B.Sc.) with a strong focus on computational ecology. If I had not become a scientist, I would still be a shepherd in Karabük, in the landscapes shown in the image below.

If you have any further questions, you are more than welcome to reach out to me via the contact section in the top-right corner.
