Hello! My name is Bedirhan Avdancı, and I am a biology graduate (B.Sc.). I am deeply interested in microbial ecology and environmental toxicology.
Science has been my dream and passion since childhood, and working with soil ecosystems has strengthened this passion even further. What once were childhood dreams have now become my academic and professional goals, and I am working with dedication to turn them into reality!
