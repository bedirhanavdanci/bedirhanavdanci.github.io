Hello! My name is Bedirhan Avdancı, and I am a fourth-year Bachelor’s degree student in the Biology Department at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey. I am interested in microbial ecology and environmental toxicology.
Science has been my dream and passion since childhood, and studying soil and learning about it has fueled this passion even more! My childhood dreams are now my current objectives, and I am working hard to make them a reality!
